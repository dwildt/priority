# Fix Three Priority Matrix Issues

## Task 1: Do First Box Ordering Using Battle Mode Results
**Problem**: Do First quadrant uses generic priority scores instead of battle mode rankings
**Solution**:
- Store battle mode results in localStorage for persistence
- Modify quadrant rendering to use battle rankings when available
- Fall back to priority score ordering when no battle results exist

## Task 2: Fix "The One" Box Button Functionality
**Problem**: Buttons in The One display don't work due to missing event listeners
**Solution**:
- Create a new method specifically for The One task element that properly attaches event listeners
- Update `updateTheOneDisplay()` to use this new method instead of innerHTML
- Ensure edit, delete, and complete buttons work properly

## Task 3: Fix Report Printing
**Problem**: Print functionality may have CSS conflicts or modal state issues
**Solution**:
- Test current print functionality to identify specific issue
- Fix any CSS conflicts in print media queries
- Ensure modal state doesn't interfere with printing
- Verify print-specific CSS classes are working correctly

I'll tackle these one by one, confirming completion of each before moving to the next.
