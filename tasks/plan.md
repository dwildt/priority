# Eisenhower Matrix Task Organization System - Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview
Build a personal task organization system using the Eisenhower Matrix with multi-language support (PT/EN/ES), vanilla JavaScript, Jest/Cypress testing, and print-ready reporting.

## 📋 Phase 1: Core Foundation (MVP for Testing)
**Goal**: Create a minimal working version to validate the concept

### 1.1 Project Setup & Structure ✅
- Initialize package.json with Jest, Cypress, and ESLint
- Create basic project structure (src/, tests/, cypress/, tasks/)
- Set up build/development scripts
- Configure linting rules

### 1.2 Documentation Setup ✅
- Create CLAUDE.md with development guidelines and commands
- Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- Create translations.md with i18n guidelines and language files structure
- Create testing.md with testing strategy and guidelines
- Save this implementation plan in tasks/plan.md

### 1.3 Basic UI & Core Functionality
- Create HTML structure with Eisenhower Matrix grid (4 quadrants)
- Implement task creation form with importance/urgency questions
- Build basic task categorization logic
- Add simple styling for matrix visualization
- Implement local storage for data persistence

### 1.4 Multi-language Support Foundation
- Create language files (en.json, pt.json, es.json)
- Implement basic i18n system for UI text
- Add language switcher

### 1.5 Initial Testing Setup
- Write unit tests for core logic (Jest)
- Create basic E2E test scenarios (Cypress)
- Set up linting checks

## 📈 Phase 2: Enhanced Features
**Goal**: Add advanced functionality and user experience improvements

### 2.1 "The One" Selection System
- Implement battle-style task comparison within Important+Urgent quadrant
- Create pairwise comparison UI for determining priority
- Add ranking algorithm to identify "The One"

### 2.2 Advanced Task Management
- Add task editing/deletion capabilities
- Implement task status tracking (pending/completed)
- Add due dates and notes to tasks

### 2.3 Enhanced UI/UX
- Improve visual design and responsiveness
- Add drag-and-drop between quadrants
- Implement task filtering and search

## 📊 Phase 3: Reporting & Export
**Goal**: Create comprehensive reporting functionality

### 3.1 Report Generation
- Design print-ready report layout
- Implement "The One" + "Up Next" + Matrix sections
- Add export to PDF functionality
- Create summary statistics

### 3.2 Data Management
- Add import/export functionality (JSON)
- Implement data backup/restore
- Add bulk task operations

## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Order

**Week 1**: Phase 1 (MVP)
- ✅ Day 1: Project setup, documentation files
- Day 2-3: Basic structure, core matrix functionality
- Day 4-5: Task creation, basic UI
- Day 6-7: i18n foundation, initial tests

**Week 2**: Phase 2 (Enhanced Features)
- Day 1-3: "The One" battle system
- Day 4-5: Advanced task management
- Day 6-7: UI/UX improvements

**Week 3**: Phase 3 (Reporting)
- Day 1-3: Report generation and print layout
- Day 4-5: Export functionality
- Day 6-7: Data management features

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Phase 1
- [x] All documentation files created and up-to-date
- [ ] User can add tasks with importance/urgency ratings
- [ ] Tasks automatically categorize into correct quadrants
- [ ] Basic UI shows all 4 matrix quadrants clearly
- [ ] Language switching works (EN/PT/ES)
- [ ] All tests pass (Jest + Cypress + ESLint)
- [ ] Data persists between sessions

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Create basic HTML structure (index.html)
3. Implement core JavaScript modules (Matrix, Task, I18n)
4. Add basic CSS styling
5. Set up initial tests
6. Create language files
7. Test MVP functionality

This phased approach allows you to test and validate the core concept quickly, then iterate based on feedback.
